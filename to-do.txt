ok first of all i redid the app using fragments .. i used them because all the activities had a common layout with different colors in the main header .

thigs to fix

1) equally assign width to cards in the gridlayout in fragment_main_navigator or
we can also add cards dynamically inflating from nav_card - to be decided

2) add transitions to fragments
3) fix the circle drawable to be a proper circle in any case
4) how are we implementing suggestions  ?? :p
